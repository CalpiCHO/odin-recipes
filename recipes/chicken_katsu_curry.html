        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Katsu curry is just a variation of Japanese curry with a chicken cutlet on top.
            <a href="https://japan.recipetineats.com/chicken-cutlet-japanese-chicken-schnitzel/"><en>Chicken Cutlet</en></a>
            (Japanese version of chicken schnitzel) brings the Japanese curry up to the next level. It’s so delicious and filling.
        </p>
        <p>Curry was introduced to Japan by the British in the Meiji era and is considered to be a 
            Western cuisine. This Western-style curry differs from the Indian-style curry, which is also popular 
            (the presence of Indian restaurants in Japan saw a big increase in the 1990s)
